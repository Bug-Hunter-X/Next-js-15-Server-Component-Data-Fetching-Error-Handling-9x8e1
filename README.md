This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to error handling during data fetching within server components. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code where a failed API request results in a silent failure. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that gracefully handles errors, improving the user experience and application robustness.
